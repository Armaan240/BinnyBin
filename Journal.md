### *(8AM-10AM)(70-75min -> RND ,35-40 min -> Test Code)*
the Idea of binny was not orignally mine ,it was brainstromed by Someone (if you know you know), but yah i started reseraching and seeing some videos for inspirtation 
and Decided that i can make such dustbin by ardiuno nano and ultrasonic sensor thus i saw some datasheet for ultrasonic sensor and finalized the circuit but before that I needed 
to confirm that how could I control Action and Delete Files From Recycle Bin , Hmm after understanding and taking some help from my Sister (She is A software Developer) I decided to make 
a test Script For Arduino Nano To just Pass (Triger) to serial out put which would be read by Python script running at the background, I used serial library and Tested The Functioning ,uhh i 
don't why it happens to me only I forgot to write code in my laptop to track coding time but though I making a journal so keeping an acurtae track of everything
Here Is the Test Code And Video
