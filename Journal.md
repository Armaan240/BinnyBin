### *(8AM-10AM)(70-75min -> RND ,35-40 min -> Test Code)*
the Idea of binny was not orignally mine ,it was brainstromed by Someone (if you know you know), but yah i started reseraching and seeing some videos for inspirtation 
and Decided that i can make such dustbin by ardiuno nano and ultrasonic sensor thus i saw some datasheet for ultrasonic sensor and finalized the circuit but before that I needed 
to confirm that how could I control Action and Delete Files From Recycle Bin , Hmm after understanding and taking some help from my Sister (She is A software Developer) I decided to make 
a test Script For Arduino Nano To just Pass (Triger) to serial out put which would be read by Python script running at the background, I used serial library and Tested The Functioning ,uhh i 
don't why it happens to me only I forgot to write code in my laptop to track coding time but though I making a journal so keeping an acurtae track of everything

### *(4PM-4:30PM)(Debuging)*
The code Which i Wrote Before Had Some Compiling issues so i look out some of errors and corrected them ,as i was writing arduino code after a long times so mistake happened but now it was fully working ,so the logic of the code is that if press the rest buuton on nano it runs the code and the as toldabove the python scripts read the trigger command running at the background
Here Is the Test Code And a Video
